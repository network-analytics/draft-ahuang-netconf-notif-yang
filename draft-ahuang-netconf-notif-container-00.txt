1.  Introduction

   YANG-Push [RFC8639] allow NETCONF [RFC6241] servers and YANG-Push
   publishers to send notifications to a data collection.  The NETCONF
   client and the YANG-Push receiver decodes the message and optionally
   validates the header and the content before forward it to the next
   process.

Internet-Draft      YANG-Push Notification Container      September 2024


   The notification container from YANG-Push was defined based on the
   XML model from NETCONF Event Notifications [RFC5277].  This model
   only has a single mandatory "eventTime" leaf and does not provide
   extensability features.  Additionally, this XML model is only valid
   for XML-based environments.  When messages are encoded in other YANG
   encodings, such as JSON [RFC7951] or CBOR [RFC9254], validators
   cannot use pure YANG to complete validate the message.

   For such reasons, this document proposes the following.  First, it
   provides an extensible Notification header allowing implementors and
   IETF contributors to easily add new metadata to the Notification
   message.  Second, it provides the first crutial extensions enabling
   operators to track the versions of the subscribed YANG modules and
   the identification of the node that pushes the YANG-Push messages.
   And finally, it provides a way to enable and disable these extensions
   on a subscription basis, making the cohexistence of different YANG-
   Push and NETCONF Event Notification [RFC5277] possible.

2.  Relationship to past documents

   This section exposes the relationship to [RFC5277], [RFC8639],
   [RFC7951] and [RFC9254].

2.1.  Relationship to RFC5277

   [RFC5277] defines a mechanism for NETCONF nodes to send notifications
   to a collector.  These are the key relationships between the current
   document and [RFC5277]:

   *  This document does not change the structure defined by [RFC5277]
      nor update any behavior defined in [RFC5277].  Implementations of
      [RFC5277] use the header defined in Section 2.2.1 of [RFC5277].

2.2.  Relationship to RFC8639

   Subscribed Notifications [RFC8639] defines a mechanism on top of
   [RFC5277] to stream notifications from the NETCONF node.  These are
   the key relationships between the current document and [RFC8639]:

   *  Section 1.4 of [RFC8639] states that the the solution uses the
      notification structure defined in [RFC5277].  This document
      proposes a new structure that NETCONF clients can enable.  When
      the this new strcture is used, Notification messages are encoded
      as defined in Section Section 3.3.

Internet-Draft      YANG-Push Notification Container      September 2024


   *  Section 2.4.2 of [RFC8639] defines how a YANG-Push subscription is
      defined via an the 'establish-subscription' RPC.  This document
      extends the RPCs from Subscribed Notifications [RFC8639] to
      support enabling the new header defined in this document.

2.3.  Relationship to RFC7950

   [RFC7950] defines how YANG data is encoded in XML.  These are the key
   relationship points between the current document and [RFC7950]:

   *  Section 4.2.10 of [RFC7950] defines the XML encoding of YANG
      notification.  This document defines a new header for such
      Notifications.  When a NETCONF server or YANG-Push publisher
      implements this document, the Notifications are encoded following
      Section 3.3.2.1.

2.4.  Relationship to RFC7951

   [RFC7951] defines how YANG data is encoded using JSON.  These are the
   key relationship points between the current document and [RFC7951]:

   *  [RFC7951] does not define explicitely how a YANG notification
      should be encoded using JSON encoding.  This document specifies a
      new header for such notifications.  When a NETCONF server or YANG-
      Push publisher implements this document, the Notifications are
      encoded following Section 3.3.2.2.

2.5.  Relationship to RFC9254

   [RFC9254] defines how YANG data is encoded using CBOR.  These are the
   key relationship points between the current document and [RFC9254]:

   *  [RFC9254] does not define explicitely how a YANG notification
      should be encoded using CBOR encoding.  [RFC9254] states that
      Notifications are container-like instances.  When a NETCONF server
      or YANG-Push publisher implements this document, the Notifications
      are encoded following Section 3.3.2.3.

3.  Solution

   Section 4.2.10 of [RFC7950] defines the encoding of YANG
   Notifications.  A YANG Notification is defined by using the
   'notification' statement.  When a NETCONF server sends this
   notification, it is composed of two parts: a header containing
   metadata and the content of the notification.

Internet-Draft      YANG-Push Notification Container      September 2024


   In [RFC7950], the Notification header is based on the model defined
   in [RFC5277] which contains a single metadata 'eventTime' leaf as
   shown in the following XML example:

     <notification
         xmlns="urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:notification:1.0">
       <eventTime>2007-09-01T10:00:00Z</eventTime>
       <link-failure xmlns="urn:example:system">
         <if-name>so-1/2/3.0</if-name>
         <if-admin-status>up</if-admin-status>
         <if-oper-status>down</if-oper-status>
       </link-failure>
     </notification>

   This document defines a new Notification header and enables extending
   it with new metadata.  The Notification header defined in the
   following sections is to be used in YANG-Push [RFC8641] environments.
   It can be both implemented with NETCONF and RESTCONF.

   Section 3.1 defines how a client enables the header defined in this
   document.  Section 3.2 extends the model from [RFC9196] to enable
   NETCONF clients to discover the capability of using the new header.
   Lastly, Section 3.3.2 defines the new header and how it is encoded
   using XML, JSON and CBOR.

3.1.  Enabling the Notification Envelope

   The use of the Notification envelope defined in this document can be
   enabled during the configuration of a YANG-Push subscription.  This
   document augments the "ietf-subscribed-notification" model [RFC8639]
   to support the configuration of "notification-envelope".

     module: ietf-notification-container

       augment /sn:subscriptions/sn:subscription:
         +--rw enable-notification-envelope?   boolean {notification-envelope}?
         +--rw metadata
       augment /sn:establish-subscription/sn:input:
         +---w enable-notification-envelope?   boolean {notification-envelope}?
         +---w metadata
       augment /sn:modify-subscription/sn:input:
         +---w enable-notification-envelope?   boolean {notification-envelope}?
         +---w metadata

Internet-Draft      YANG-Push Notification Container      September 2024


   When the node 'enable-notification-envelope' is set to true, the
   notifications produced by a NETCONF server MUST use the structure
   defined in Section 3.3.1.  If any metadata is enabled during the
   configuration of the subscription, the metadata nodes MUST be present
   in the header.

3.2.  Discovering the support of this model

   TODO: move capabilities here

3.3.  Notification Envelope

   This section defines how NETCONF YANG Notifications are structured
   when the notification envelope is enabled.  It defines how this model
   is used when encoded in XML, JSON and CBOR.

3.3.1.  Base Notification Model

   When a YANG-Push publisher uses the Notification Model defined in
   this document, the notification is structured as following:

   *  The header of the notification contains the metadata that is
      enabled during the configuration of the subscription.

   *  The content of the notification defined by the 'notification'
      statement is encoded in the 'notification-contents' leaf.

   The following YANG tree [RFC8340] illustrates the notification
   envelope containing the metadata 'event-time' and 'some-other-
   metadata'.

     notifications:
       +---n notification-envelope
         +--ro event-time               yang:date-and-time
         +--ro some-other-metadata      string
         +--ro notification-contents?   <anydata>

   The following sections defines the encodings of this header.

3.3.2.  Encoding of the Notification model

   The YANG Notification can be encoded using XML
   [W3C.REC-xml-20001006][RFC7951], JSON [RFC7951] and CBOR [RFC9254].

3.3.2.1.  XML encoding

   The same structure as defined in Section 4 of [RFC5277] is used.  The
   structure uses the XML namespace that has been defined in [RFC5277]:

Internet-Draft      YANG-Push Notification Container      September 2024


       urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:notification:1.0

   Two child nodes within the "notification" container are expected,
   representing the event time and the notification payload.  The
   "eventTime" node is defined within the same XML namespace as the
   "notification" element and is compliant with [RFC3339].

   The name and namespace of the payload element are determined by the
   YANG module containing the notification statement representing the
   notification message.

   The following example shows a "push-update" notification defined in
   the YANG module of YANG-Push [RFC8641] encoded in XML:

     <notification xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:notification:1.0">
       <eventTime>2022-09-02T10:59:55.32Z</eventTime>
       <push-update xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-push">
         <id>1011</id>
         <datastore-contents>
           <interfaces xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-interfaces">
             <interface>
               <name>eth0</name>
               <oper-status>up</oper-status>
             </interface>
           </interfaces>
         </datastore-contents>
       </push-update>
     </notification>

                     Figure 1: XML-encoded notification

3.3.2.2.  JSON Encoding

   A YANG notification encoded in JSON is structured as a root
   "notification" container.  The namespace of this container is the
   name of the YANG module "ietf-notification" defined in Section 4.

   Two child nodes within the "ietf-notification:notification" container
   are expected, representing the event time and the notification
   payload.  The "eventTime" node is defined within the same namespace
   as the "ietf-notification:notification" container and is compliant
   with [RFC3339].

   The following example shows a "push-update" notification defined in
   the YANG module of YANG-Push [RFC8641] encoded in JSON:

                               }
                           }
                       ]
                   }
               }
           }
       }

                    Figure 2: JSON-encoded notification

   When Notifications are implemented within RESTCONF [RFC8040]
   environments, the namespace of a notification stays "ietf-
   restconf:notification" as defined in Section 6.4 of [RFC8040].

3.3.2.3.  CBOR Encoding

   YANG data can be represented in CBOR using Names or SIDs in keys.
   The following sections shows how these messages are encoded in both
   cases.

3.3.2.3.1.  CBOR encoded messages using keys

   Notifications encoded using keys is similar to JSON encoding as
   defined in Section 3.3 of [RFC9254].  The key of the element can be
   the element itself or be namespace-qualified.  In the latter case,
   the namespace of the notification container uses the YANG module name
   "ietf-notification" defined in Section 4.

   Two child nodes within the "ietf-notification:notification" container
   are expected, representing the event time and the notification
   payload.  The "eventTime" node is defined within the same namespace
   as the "ietf-notification:notification" container and is compliant
   with [RFC3339].

   The following example shows a "push-update" notification defined in

                               }
                           }
                       ]
                   }
               }
           }
       }

3.3.2.3.2.  CBOR encoded messages using YANG-SIDs

   A Notification encoded using YANG-SIDs replaces the names of the keys
   of the CBOR encoded message for a 63 bit unsigned integer.  This is
   defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC9254] and a process for SID allocation
   is defined in [I-D.ietf-core-sid].

   Two child nodes within the root container are expected, representing
   the event time and the notification payload.  The root container and
   the "eventTime" node uses a SID and the content of the "eventTime" is
   compliant with [RFC3339].

   This is an example of YANG-CBOR encoded notification using YANG SIDs
   [RFC9254].  The Figure 4 shows the message using the CBOR diagnostic
   notation as defined in section 3.1 of [RFC9254]:

4.1.  YANG Module

   The YANG module uses the same namespace from the XML Schema defined
   in Section 4 of [RFC5277] allowing to use this YANG module to also
   validate already implemented XML encoded NETCONF Event Notifications.

Internet-Draft       NETCONF Event Notification YANG           June 2024


1.  Introduction

   NETCONF Event Notifications [RFC5277] and YANG-Push [RFC8639] allow
   NETCONF [RFC6241] servers and YANG-Push publishers to send
   notifications to a data collection.  The NETCONF client and the YANG-
   Push receiver decodes the message and optionally validates the header
   and the content before forward it to the next process.  This schema
   validation process ensures to not break the data processing chain.

   The structure of a NETCONF Event notification has been defined in
   [RFC5277] using a XML Schema [W3C.REC-xml-20001006] allowing NETCONF
   nodes to validate the header schema of the notification message when
   it is encoded in XML.  However, when these notifications are sent
   using YANG-Push [RFC8639][RFC8641], they can be encoded in other
   encodings such as JSON [RFC7951] or CBOR [RFC9254].  In such cases,
   the model defined in [RFC5277] cannot be used to validate the
   notification header.

   This document defines the content of the header of such notifications
   allowing implementations to validate the schema of the notifications
   when they are encoded in other encodings than XML.  A YANG 1.1
   [RFC7950] model is defined for such purposes.

   This document updates [RFC5277], [RFC8639] and [RFC7951] specifying
   how a Notification header should be encoded.  RESTCONF Notifications
   [RFC8040] are out of scope of this document.

2.  Relationship to past documents

   This section exposes the relationship to [RFC5277], [RFC8639],
   [RFC7951] and [RFC9254].

2.1.  Relationship to RFC5277

   [RFC5277] defines a mechanism for NETCONF nodes to send notifications
   to a collector.  These are the key relationships between the current
   document and [RFC5277]:

   *  Section 2.1 of [RFC5277] defines how to configure a subscription
      to receive NETCONF Event Notifications.  The RPCs are defined in
      the XML schema in Section 3.4 of [RFC5277].  This document does
      not update or add any new RPCs to this schema.

   *  The notification structure is defined in Section 4 of [RFC5277]
      using a XML schema.  This document defines the structure of the
      notification in XML, JSON and CBOR in Section 4.  In XML, the same
      structure is used.

Internet-Draft       NETCONF Event Notification YANG           June 2024


2.2.  Relationship to RFC8639

   Subscribed Notifications [RFC8639] defines a mechanism on top of
   [RFC5277] to stream notifications from the NETCONF node.  These are
   the key relationships between the current document and [RFC8639]:

   *  Section 1.4 of [RFC8639] states that the the solution uses the
      notification structure defined in [RFC5277].  This document
      replaces this structure using a YANG module allowing JSON and CBOR
      encodings.

2.3.  Relationship to RFC7951

   [RFC7951] defines how YANG data is encoded using JSON.  These are the
   key relationship points between the current document and [RFC7951]:

   *  [RFC7951] does not define explicitely how a YANG notification
      should be encoded using JSON encoding.  This document specifies
      the structure of such notification for JSON when these are used in
      a NETCONF [RFC6241] environment.

2.4.  Relationship to RFC9254

   [RFC9254] defines how YANG data is encoded using CBOR.  These are the
   key relationship points between the current document and [RFC9254]:

   *  [RFC9254] does not define explicitely how a YANG notification
      should be encoded using CBOR encoding.  [RFC9254] states that
      Notifications are container-like instances which does not follow
      how notifications are encoded in XML and JSON encodings.  This
      document replaces this statement and ensures consistency between
      the different notification structures in YANG.  This structure is
      to be used within NETCONF [RFC6241] environments.

3.  Differences to draft-ietf-netconf-notification-messages

   Note to the RFC-Editor: Please remove this section before publishing.

   [I-D.ietf-netconf-notification-messages] proposes a structure to send
   multiple notifications in a single message.  Unlike
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-notification-messages], this document defines a
   YANG module to encode NETCONF Notifications with encodings other than
   XML, which is currently not existing.  The structure for NETCONF
   notifications is defined in [RFC5277] using a XSD, but there is no
   YANG module defining the structure of the notification message sent
   by a server when the message is encoded in JSON [RFC7951] or CBOR
   [RFC9254].

4.  NETCONF Notification structure

   This section defines how NETCONF YANG Notifications are structured in
   XML, JSON and CBOR encodings.  The same namespace "ietf-notification"
   is used to be compliant with [RFC5277].

4.1.  XML Structure

   The same structure as defined in Section 4 of [RFC5277] is used.  The
   structure uses the XML namespace that has been defined in [RFC5277]:

     urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:notification:1.0

   Two child nodes within the "notification" container are expected,
   representing the event time and the notification payload.  The
   "eventTime" node is defined within the same XML namespace as the
   "notification" element and is compliant with [RFC3339].

   The name and namespace of the payload element are determined by the
   YANG module containing the notification statement representing the
   notification message.

   The following example shows a "push-update" notification defined in
   the YANG module of YANG-Push [RFC8641] encoded in XML:

   <notification xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:notification:1.0">
     <eventTime>2022-09-02T10:59:55.32Z</eventTime>
     <push-update xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-push">
       <id>1011</id>
       <datastore-contents>
         <interfaces xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-interfaces">
           <interface>
             <name>eth0</name>
             <oper-status>up</oper-status>
           </interface>
         </interfaces>
       </datastore-contents>
     </push-update>
   </notification>

                     Figure 1: XML-encoded notification

4.2.  JSON Structure

   A YANG notification encoded in JSON is structured as a root
   "notification" container.  The namespace of this container is the
   name of the YANG module "ietf-notification" defined in Section 5.

Internet-Draft       NETCONF Event Notification YANG           June 2024


   Two child nodes within the "ietf-notification:notification" container
   are expected, representing the event time and the notification
   payload.  The "eventTime" node is defined within the same namespace
   as the "ietf-notification:notification" container and is compliant
   with [RFC3339].

   The following example shows a "push-update" notification defined in
   the YANG module of YANG-Push [RFC8641] encoded in JSON:

   {
       "ietf-notification:notification": {
           "eventTime": "2023-02-10T08:00:11.22Z",
           "ietf-yang-push:push-update": {
               "id": 1011,
               "datastore-contents": {
                   "ietf-interfaces:interfaces": [
                       {
                           "interface": {
                               "name": "eth0",
                               "oper-status": "up"
                           }
                       }
                   ]
               }
           }
       }
   }

                    Figure 2: JSON-encoded notification

   When Notifications are implemented within RESTCONF [RFC8040]
   environments, the namespace of a notification stays "ietf-
   restconf:notification" as defined in Section 6.4 of [RFC8040].

4.3.  CBOR Structure

   YANG data can be represented in CBOR using Names or SIDs in keys.
   The following sections shows how these messages are encoded in both
   cases.

4.3.1.  CBOR encoded messages

   Notifications encoded using keys is similar to JSON encoding as
   defined in Section 3.3 of [RFC9254].  The key of the element can be
   the element itself or be namespace-qualified.  In the latter case,
   the namespace of the notification container uses the YANG module name
   "ietf-notification" defined in Section 5.

   Two child nodes within the "ietf-notification:notification" container
   are expected, representing the event time and the notification
   payload.  The "eventTime" node is defined within the same namespace
   as the "ietf-notification:notification" container and is compliant
   with [RFC3339].

   The following example shows a "push-update" notification defined in
   the YANG module of YANG-Push [RFC8641] encoded in CBOR using names as
   keys.  The example uses the CBOR diagnostic notation as defined in
   section 3.1 of [RFC9254]:

   {
       "ietf-notification:notification": {
           "eventTime": "2023-02-10T08:00:11.22Z",
           "ietf-yang-push:push-update": {
               "id": 1011,
               "datastore-contents": {
                   "ietf-interfaces:interfaces": [
                       {
                           "interface": {
                               "name": "eth0",
                               "oper-status": "up"
                           }
                       }
                   ]
               }
           }
       }
   }

       Figure 3: CBOR-encoded notification using diagnostic notation

4.3.2.  CBOR encoded messages using YANG-SIDs

   A Notification encoded using YANG-SIDs replaces the names of the keys
   of the CBOR encoded message for a 63 bit unsigned integer.  This is
   defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC9254] and a process for SID allocation
   is defined in [I-D.ietf-core-sid].

   Two child nodes within the root container are expected, representing
   the event time and the notification payload.  The root container and
   the "eventTime" node uses a SID and the content of the "eventTime" is
   compliant with [RFC3339].

   This is an example of YANG-CBOR encoded notification using YANG SIDs
   [RFC9254].  The Figure 4 shows the message using the CBOR diagnostic
   notation as defined in section 3.1 of [RFC9254]:

5.  YANG Module

5.1.  YANG Tree Diagram

   This YANG module adds a structure with one leaf for the datetime as
   defined in section 2.2.1 of [RFC5277].  The name of the leaf matches
   the definition of the XSD element name defined in Section 4 of
   [RFC5277].

   module: ietf-notification

     structure notification:
       +-- eventTime    yang:date-and-time

5.2.  YANG Module

   The YANG module uses the same namespace from the XML Schema defined
   in Section 4 of [RFC5277] allowing to use this YANG module to also
   validate already implemented XML encoded NETCONF Event Notifications.

    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a new extensible notification structure, defined in YANG, 
      for use in YANG-Push Notification messages enabling any YANG-compatible encodings
      such as XML, JSON, or CBOR. Additionally, it defines two essential extensions to this
      structure, the support of a hostname and a sequence number and the support of a
      timestamp characterizing the moment when the changed data was observed.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

      <t>YANG-Push <xref target="RFC8639"/> allows publishers to send notifications to a
      data collection system. The YANG-Push receiver decodes the message and optionally validates
      the header and the content before forwarding to the next process in the data collection
      system.</t>

      <t>The notification container from YANG-Push is currently based on the XML model 
      from NETCONF Event Notifications <xref target="RFC5277"/>. This model has
      the drawback that only a single mandatory "eventTime" leaf is defined and does not offer a way
      to extend this header with new notification metadata.
      Additionally, this XML model is only valid for XML-based environments. When messages
      are encoded in other YANG encodings, such as JSON <xref target="RFC7951"/> or CBOR
      <xref target="RFC9254"/>, validators cannot use YANG to validate
      the message schema.</t>

      <t>YANG data consumers receiving notifications require additional notification metadata to
      understand the full context of the received message. For example, in addition to the
      timestamp of when the event was encoded, it is also important to know the timestamp when
      the metrics were observed, the hostname that sourced the message, and have
      sequence numbers. The hostname is required because 
      transport-level source information is not preserved once notifications are 
      forwarded to downstream systems, and having sequence numbers at the notification level enable
      operators to detect lost notifications throughout the data processing chain.
      This additional notification metadata is
      also helpful in correlating the data with other sources of Network Telemetry <xref
      target="RFC9232"/> information.</t>

      <t>For such reasons, this document proposes the following:
    
        <ul>
          <li>First, it provides an extensible YANG notification header allowing
          implementors and Authors of Internet-Drafts to easily add new notification metadata to the
          notification message.</li>
    
          <li>Second, it provides the first crucial extensions enabling operators to
          identify which network node publishes which YANG-Push messages and when the events
          or metrics were observed on the network node.</li>
    
          <li>And finally, it provides a way to enable and disable these extensions globally
          at the server, making the coexistence of different YANG-Push and NETCONF Event
          Notification <xref target="RFC5277"/> possible.</li>
    </ul>
    
    </t>
    
      <!-- <t>The structure of a NETCONF Event notification has been
      defined in <xref target="RFC5277"/> using a XML Schema 
      <xref target="W3C.REC-xml-20001006"/> allowing NETCONF nodes
      to validate the header schema of the notification message when it is encoded in XML.
      However, when these notifications are sent using YANG-Push
      <xref target="RFC8639"/><xref target="RFC8641"/>, they can be encoded in other
      encodings such as JSON <xref target="RFC7951"/> or CBOR <xref target="RFC9254"/>.
      In such cases, the model defined in <xref target="RFC5277"/> cannot be used to
      validate the notification header.
      </t> -->

    <section anchor="overview" title="Notification Envelope Model">

      <t>Section 4.2.10 of <xref target="RFC7950"/> defines the encoding of YANG notifications.
      A notification is defined by a 'notification' statement in the YANG module.
      When a NETCONF server sends a notification, it comprises two parts: a header
      containing notification metadata that encapsulates the content and the content defined
      by the 'notification' statement.</t>
      
      <t>In YANG 1.1 <xref target="RFC7950"/>, the notification header is based on the model
      defined in <xref target="RFC5277"/> which contains a single metadata 'eventTime'
      leaf. An example extracted from <xref target="RFC7950"/> is shown in the following XML:</t>

      <sourcecode type="xml"><![CDATA[
  <notification
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:notification:1.0">
    <eventTime>2007-09-01T10:00:00Z</eventTime>
    <link-failure xmlns="urn:example:system">
      <if-name>so-1/2/3.0</if-name>
      <if-admin-status>up</if-admin-status>
      <if-oper-status>down</if-oper-status>
    </link-failure>
  </notification>
]]></sourcecode>

      <t>This document defines a new notification header and enables extending 
      this header with new notification metadata.
      The notification header and extensions defined in the following sections
      are to be used in YANG-Push <xref target="RFC8641"/> environments and
      can be implemented with NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/>
      and RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>. Thus, when enabled, this new header
      globally replaces all notifications defined in both Subscribed Notifications
      <xref target="RFC8639"/> and YANG-Push <xref target="RFC8641"/>
      for the entire server.</t>
      
      <t><xref target="enable-notif"/> defines how a client enables the header defined in this document.
      <xref target="discovery-notif"/> extends the model from <xref target="RFC9196"/> to enable clients to discover the capability of using the new notification header
      for both implementation-time and runtime information.
      Lastly, <xref target="encodings-notif"/> defines the new notification header and how
      it is encoded using XML, JSON, and CBOR.</t>

      <section anchor="enable-notif" title="Enabling the Notification Envelope">
        <t>The notification envelope defined in this document can be enabled either prior to
        or within the same NETCONF transaction that configures the YANG-Push subscriptions.
        This document augments the "ietf-subscribed-notification" model <xref target="RFC8639"/>
        to support the configuration of the "notification-envelope". When the node 'enable-notification-envelope' is enabled, all the 
        notifications defined in Subscribed Notification <xref target="RFC8639"/> and
        YANG-Push <xref target="RFC8641"/> are encoded as defined in <xref target="struct-notif"/>.
        If additionally, any notification metadata is enabled, the notification metadata nodes are present in the header.
        When the node 'enable-notification-envelope' is disabled, notifications are encoded as defined in NETCONF Event Notifications <xref target="RFC5277"/>.

        <!-- <t>When the node 'enable-notification-envelope' is set to true, the notifications published
        by a YANG-Push publisher MUST use the header defined in <xref target="base-notif-model"/>.
        If any notification metadata is enabled during the subscription configuration, the
        notification metadata nodes MUST be present in the header.
        When this node is disabled, notifications are encoded as defined in NETCONF Event Notifications <xref target="RFC5277"/>.
        </t> -->

        <!-- <t>When there are existing subscriptions and a client changes the node 'enable-notification-envelope',
        all existing subscriptions MUST be terminated. The publisher MUST send a 'subscription-terminated'
        notification to all the existing subscriptions using the header configured before the change.
        Any new subscription after the change uses the header defined by the node 'enable-notification-envelope',
        i.e. encoded as
        <xref target="base-notif-model"/> when enabled and as defined in <xref target="RFC5277"/> if disabled.</t> -->

        <t>When active subscriptions exist, the 'enable-notification-envelope'
        node MUST NOT be modified until all such subscriptions have been
        terminated. The publisher MUST reject any attempt to change the
        'enable-notification-envelope' node while active subscriptions are actively sending notifications.
        Any new subscription after the change uses the header defined by the node 'enable-notification-envelope',
        i.e. encoded as
        <xref target="base-notif-model"/> when enabled and as defined in <xref target="RFC5277"/> if disabled.</t>

        <t>Per-subscription support for this header was considered during the definition
        of this specification, however, a network node-wide setting was chosen to simplify network
        operations. In practice, operators use YANG-Push subscriptions in large-scale deployments
        where numerous subscriptions are created on each network node. While per-subscription
        configuration provides more flexibility, maintaining the choice 
        of header format for each subscription adds significant operational complexity when troubleshooting
        or migrating to a new header format. The desire for simplifying operations led to the definition of 
        a global configuration knob for the notification envelope.</t>

            <t>YANG notifications can be encoded in CBOR using Names or SIDs in keys.</t>

            <t>Notifications encoded using names is similar to JSON encoding as defined in
            Section 3.3 of <xref target="RFC9254"/>. The key of the element can be the name of
            the element itself or be namespace-qualified. In the latter case, the namespace of the
            notification container uses the YANG module name "ietf-yp-notification", defined
            in <xref target="ietf-yp-notification-yang-module"/>.</t>

            <t>Notification encoded using YANG-SIDs replaces the names of
            the keys of the CBOR encoded message with a 63-bit unsigned integer.
            In this case, the keys of the encoded data use the SID value as defined in 
            <xref section="3.2" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9254"/>.
            A SID allocation process is needed beforehand as defined in <xref target="RFC9595"/>.</t>

            <t>In the notification, two mandatory child nodes within the "ietf-yp-notification:envelope" container
            are expected, representing the event time and the notification
            payload. The "event-time" node is defined within the same namespace as the 
            "ietf-yp-notification:envelope" container.</t>

            <t>When other notification metadata is enabled through configuration, the
            supplementary nodes are encoded at the same level as the mandatory "event-time"
            node. The YANG nodes in the notification header use the YANG module name
            from the module that defines the nodes as its namespace when they are encoded as names.
            When encoded using YANG SIDs, the SID value assigned to the
            metadata node is used. A .sid file requesting the SID values for
            the metadata defined in this document can be found in <xref target="sid_appendix"/>.
            The .sid file includes the metadata defined in <xref target="extensions-notif"/>.</t>

            <t>The content of the notification that is defined by the 'notification' statement is
            encoded in the "contents" node.
            The name and namespace of this payload element are determined by the

        <t>When YANG-Push notification messages are forwarded from a
        receiver to another system, such as a message broker or a time series
        database, the transport context is lost since it is not part of the
        notification metadata of the notification container. Therefore, the downstream
        system is unable to associate the message with the publishing process (the
        exporting network node), nor able to detect message loss or reordering.</t>

        <t>To correlate network data among different Network Telemetry planes as
        described in <xref section="3.1" target="RFC9232"/> or among different
        YANG-Push subscription types as defined in <xref section="3.1"
        target="RFC8641"/>, a reference to the node streaming the data is
        needed. This is essential for understanding the timely relationship
        among these different planes and YANG-Push subscription types.</t>

        <t>Today, network operators work around this impediment by preserving
        the transport source IP address and sequence numbers of the publishing
        process. However, this implies encoding this information in the YANG-Push
        notification messages which impact the semantic readability of the
        message in the downstream system.</t>

        <t>On top of that, the transport source IP address might not represent
        the management IP address by which the YANG-Push publisher should be
        known. In other terms, the "source-host" <xref target="RFC6470"/>, which
        is the "Address of the remote host for the session" might not be the
        management IP address.</t>

        <t>To overcome these issues, this document defines a notification
          container extension with a hostname and a sequence number. This allows
          the downstream system to not only be able to identify from which network
          node, subscription, and time the message was published but also, the order
          of the published messages.</t>

      <section title="Support of Observation Timestamp">

        <t>To correlate network data among different Network Telemetry planes, as
        described in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC9232"/>, or among different
        YANG-Push subscription types, as defined in Section 3.1 of <xref
        target="RFC8641"/>, a receiver needs a 
        timestamp reference to align all the metrics and events.
        The observation timestamp defined in this document characterizes the moment the state
        change was observed or the moment when the data was measured, so that a receiver can
        correctly align the collected data.
        </t>

        <t>The delay between the YANG-Push export process and the reception of the message 
        at the receiver instance can be measured using the node 'event-time' defined in <xref target="base-notif-model"/>.
        However, as the 'event-time' node only establishes the moment when the YANG-Push message was crafted and sent,
        the moment when such metrics were collected or the state changes were observed cannot be measured using this timestamp.
        The observation timestamp defined in this section characterizes the moment when the metrics were observed, 
        which enable aligning the received metrics to the actual moment they were measured.
        </t>

        <t>When the time bucket length in a time series database and the
        periodic YANG-Push subscription time are configured with the same values,
        the 'event-time' of the NETCONF notification message header can be used for indexing
        the data in the time series database.
        There is a variable delay between the observation timestamp, the 'event-time', and
        the "anchor-time" as described in Section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC8641"/>.
        When these timestamps are close to the time bucket boundaries, a time bucket may
        experience data collection discrepancies, e.g. 0 measurements are aggregated into one time
        bucket while the next time bucket contains 2 measurements. This leads to
        inconsistent accounting errors in the time series database. This problem
        is resolved using the observation timestamp instead of the 'event-time'
        for time series database indexation.</t>

        <t>By extending YANG-Push Notifications with the observation timestamp
        and a 'point-in-time' node, the data collection process can always ensure
        it has the best available time for indexing the data.
        It can therefore use unconditionally the observation timestamp node in the data
        processing chain to correctly align the metrics and events.
        At the same time, the 'point-in-time' node ensures that the semantics associated
        with the timestamp are not lost throughout the data processing chain.</t>

        <t>Besides the Subscription ID as described in Section 3.7 of <xref
        target="RFC8641"/>, the following network observation time metadata
        objects are part of "push-update" and "push-change-update"
        notifications.</t>

        <dl>
          <dt>timestamp:</dt>

          <dd>

            notification in "periodic" subscriptions and for the "push-change-update"
            notification in "on-change" subscriptions.</t>

            <t>By comparing the observation timestamp of two "push-update"
            notifications in a periodic subscription, the collector can deduce
            the actual cadence of the measurements, and compare it with the
            subscription configuration. In case of an "on-change" subscription
            it states the time when the network state change was observed.</t>

            observation timestamp was observed. Choices are:</t>

            <t>'current-accounting' states the point in time where the metrics are
            polled and observed in "periodic" subscriptions.</t>

            <t>'initial-state' states the initial point in time when the subscription
            was established and the state was observed for "on-change sync on start"
            subscriptions.</t>

            <t>'state-changed' states the point in time when the state change was
            observed after the subscription was established for "on-change" and "on-change sync on
            start" subscriptions.</t>

            <ul>
              <li>T1: At first, the operational state of the interface is "Up". The
              subscription is not configured yet at this stage and thus,
              notifications are not triggered for this state change.</li>
              <li>T2: After configuring an 'on-change' subscription supporting 'sync on start',
              the publisher sends the initial state of the interface. The initial
              state is polled based on the event having happened at T1.</li>
              <li>T3: This is the moment the interface changes its operational status to "Down".</li>
              <li>T4: After the interface state changes at T3, the publisher generates the 'on-change'
              notification alerting the receiver.</li>

        <t>To identify which subscription filter has been applied to
        push-update and push-change-update notifications at the
        YANG-Push publisher, a YANG-Push receiver needs to correlate the
        push-update and push-change-update with subscription-start
        or subscription-modified notifications as described under 
        Data Collection Protocol Provenance in Section 2 of <xref
        target="I-D.netana-nmop-message-broker-telemetry-message"/>. 
        That requires the xpath or subtree filter information from the
        subscription-start or subscription-modified notifications
        to be persisted at the YANG-Push receiver.</t>
        
        <t>To minimize complexity in YANG-Push receiver implementations,
        the subscription filter subscription metadata is being added
        to the push-update and push-change-update notifications at the
        YANG-Push publisher.</t>

        <t>Besides the Subscription ID as described in Section 3.7 of <xref
        target="RFC8641"/>, the following subscription metadata
        objects are part of "push-update" and "push-change-update"

      Because enabling or disabling the new envelope is performed on a network element

      <t>This section uses the template described in
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis" section="3.7"/>.</t>

      <t>The "ietf-yp-notification" and "ietf-yp-observation" YANG modules define data models that are
        designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
        NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> and RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.
        These YANG-based management protocols (1) have to
        use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH <xref target="RFC6242"/>, TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/>, and
        QUIC <xref target="RFC9000"/>) and (2) have to use mutual authentication.
      </t>

      <t>The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) <xref target="RFC8341"/>
        provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
        RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
        RESTCONF protocol operations and content.
      </t>

      <t>There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
        writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true", which is the
        default).  All writable data nodes are likely to be reasonably
        sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write
        operations (e.g., edit-config) and delete operations to these data
        nodes without proper protection or authentication can have a negative
        effect on network operations.  The following subtrees and data nodes
        have particular sensitivities/vulnerabilities:
      </t>

      <ul>
        <li>/sn:subscriptions/iypn:enable-notification-envelope</li>
      </ul>

      <t>The entries in the list above will show whether the mechanism defined in
      this document is enabled. Access control MUST be set so that only someone with
      proper access permissions has the ability to access and modify this resource.</t>

      <t>Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
        sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
        important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
        notification) to these data nodes. Specifically, the following
        subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/
        vulnerabilities:
      </t>

      <ul>
        <li>/iypn:envelope/hostname</li>
      </ul>

      <t>The entries in the list above will show the identity of the originating
      device. Exposure of this information may assist an attacker in mapping the
      network or in injecting spoofed notifications. Implementations SHOULD ensure
      that access to this data is restricted and that notifications are sent over
      secure and authenticated channels.</t>

    <section title="Example extending the Notification Envelope" anchor="appendix-example">

      <t>This appendix provides a non-normative example illustrating how an extension
      to the notification envelope should be implemented. The example does not define
      valid metadata, but serves to demonstrate how future extensions should be specified.</t>
      
      <t>Specifically, the example extends the notification envelope with a metadata field named "foo".
      The YANG module illustrates the necessary augmentations to
      both the 'ietf-yp-notification' module and the 'ietf-notification-capabilities' module.</t>
